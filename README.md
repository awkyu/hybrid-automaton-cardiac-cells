BME 525 Bioelectricity Project

There have been several models of cardiac pacemaking cells that have been developed over the last half century including models specifically around the SA Node, AV Node, and Purkinje Fibers. This study explored these various models and implement them to get visualization of the currents and voltages in play, and expanded on them to various heart conditions whether that be a healthy heart under stress or exercise, or various cardiac diseases. This may give various insights and allow further exploration of how certain parameters affect the function of these cells--gate activation and inactivation functions, for example. Furthermore, the implementation of these various models may give insight as to the visual differences in the model and how they compare to each other.
